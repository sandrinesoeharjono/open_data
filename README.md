The work was conducted by Sandrine Soeharjono (sandrinesoeharjono@hotmail.com) in 2020 under the supervision of Dr Dominique Roche (dominique.roche@mail.mcgill.ca) in the Binning Laboratory (http://www.thebinninglab.com/) at Université de Montréal.

## Study Overview
This study surveyed 140 faculty members working in ecology and evolution across Canada’s top 20 ranked universities and inquired on the benefits, neutral outcomes and costs experienced from openly sharing data. The answers were compiled and compared with regards to career stage and gender. Finally, the results outline proposed by the study participants to reduce the individual costs and increase the benefits of open data for faculty members.
